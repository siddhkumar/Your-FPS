# Your-FPS
A small project to demonstrate our (my üòÅ) ability to create an FPS game.

### What am I trying to achieve?
1. Create an offline multiplayer FPS game where multiple people can connect over local network (WiFi) and play together.
2. Implement online multiplaying facility if possible.
3. Learn the art of game development. 

### External resources used
I have tried to use as less external resources as possible. However, I am not a master of all trader, so I have used some tools and resources found online, almost all of them free. 
Here is a list of external resources used - 
1. Sky HDRI - https://ambientcg.com/view?id=SkyOnlyHDRI015
2. Godot Github Integration Plugin - https://github.com/fenix-hub/godot-engine.github-integration
