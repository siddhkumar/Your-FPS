# Your-FPS
A small project to demonstrate our (my 😁) ability to create an FPS game.

### What am I trying to achieve?
1. Create an offline multiplayer FPS game where multiple people can connect over local network (WiFi) and play together.
2. Implement online multiplaying facility if possible.
3. Learn the art of game development.
