# Your-FPS
A small project to demonstrate my ability to create an FPS game.

### What am I trying to achieve?
1. Create an offline multiplayer FPS game where multiple people can connect over local network (WiFi) and play together.
2. Implement online multiplaying facility if possible.
3. Learn the art of game development.
4. Create my own assets and use as little external resources as possible. 

### External resources used
I have tried to use as less external resources as possible. However, I am not a master of all trader, so I have used some tools and resources found online, almost all of them free. 
If you own any of these assets, and are not happy with me using them, please contact and I will remove your content from this project
Here is a list of external resources used - 
1. Sky HDRI - https://ambientcg.com/view?id=SkyOnlyHDRI015
2. Godot Github Integration Plugin - https://github.com/fenix-hub/godot-engine.github-integration
3. Footstep Sound - https://freesound.org/people/xkeril/sounds/611278/
4. Rain sound - https://freesound.org/people/florianreichelt/sounds/459983/
5. Thunder sound clip 1 - https://freesound.org/people/Littlebrojay/sounds/195439/
6. Gunshot sound - https://freesound.org/people/mitchelk/sounds/136766/

### How to setup the project?
First, download and extract the zip file, and open the project in Godot.
Second, setup the input as following - 

#### Input map
1. move_forward - W or Up key
2. move_backward - S or Down key
3. move_left - A or Left key
4. move_right - D or Right key

Third, Make "Master.tscn" inside the "Networking" folder the main scene of the project.
